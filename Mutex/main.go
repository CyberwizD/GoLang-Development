// Mutex (Mutual Exclusion)

// So, a mutex, or a mutual exclusion is a mechanism
// that allows us to prevent concurrent processes
// from entering a critical section of data
// whilst itâ€™s already being executed by a given process.

// Race conditions can cause unexpected issues with your systems
// that are both hard to debug and at times, even harder to fix.

// Writing Go programs that can execute concurrently in a safe manner
// without impacting performance. This is where the mutex comes into play.

// The main goroutine calls [WaitGroup.Add] to set the number of goroutines to wait for.

// At the same time, [WaitGroup.Wait] can be used to block until all goroutines have finished.
